        - **0-10%**: Low/No inhibition (Green)
        - **10-30%**: Moderate inhibition (Yellow)

        - **>60%**: Severe inhibition (Red)
        
        ### Inhibition Types and Safety Factors:
        - **pH Inhibition**: Occurs when pH is outside the optimal range for specific microorganisms
        - **Hâ‚‚ Inhibition**: High hydrogen partial pressure inhibits syntrophic bacteria
        - **N Limitation**: Insufficient nitrogen for microbial growth
        - **NHâ‚ƒ Inhibition**: Free ammonia inhibits methanogenic activity
        - **Safety Margin**: Higher values indicate greater substrate limitation, providing better protection against shock loads and inhibitors

            - Consider reducing HRT to introduce more substrate limitation
            - Maintain consistent operating conditions
            - Monitor for inhibitory compounds that could slow the process further
